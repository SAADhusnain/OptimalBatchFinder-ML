# Batch Size Optimization in Neural Networks

## Overview
This code is a general-purpose implementation for training and evaluating a neural network to predict a target variable based on a set of input features. 
It is designed to test and compare the impact of different batch sizes on model performance by analyzing error metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## How the Code Works

### 1. Dataset Loading
- The code begins by loading data from an external file (e.g., CSV, Excel) into a pandas DataFrame. 
- The dataset should include:
  - **Features**: A set of independent variables used for predictions.
  - **Target**: A dependent variable to be predicted by the model.

### 2. Feature and Target Selection
- The user selects relevant features (independent variables) and assigns the target variable (dependent variable).

### 3. Data Splitting
- The dataset is split into training and testing subsets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn. 
- This ensures that the model is trained on one portion of the data and tested on unseen data.

### 4. Model Definition
- A neural network model is created using the Keras Sequential API:
  - **Input Layer**: Accepts the number of features in the dataset.
  - **Hidden Layers**: Layers with customizable sizes and activation functions, enabling non-linear transformations.
  - **Output Layer**: A single neuron for regression tasks (e.g., predicting continuous values).
- The model is compiled using an optimizer (`adam`) and a loss function (`mean_squared_error`).

### 5. Batch Size Testing
- A loop iterates through a predefined list of batch sizes (e.g., 8, 16, 32, etc.).
- For each batch size:
  - A new model is created and trained using the training data.
  - The training process uses the specified batch size to update model weights.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- After training, the model makes predictions on the test data.
- The predictions are compared to actual target values using error metrics:
  - **MSE**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
  - **RMSE**: Provides a more interpretable error metric by taking the square root of MSE.

### 7. Results Collection
- The MSE and RMSE for each batch size are stored in a dictionary for analysis.

### 8. Visualization
- The results are plotted to visualize the relationship between batch size and error metrics, helping to identify the optimal batch size for the given dataset.

### 9. Optimal Batch Size Identification
- The batch size with the lowest RMSE is identified and printed as the best choice for the model.

## Purpose of the Code
This code can be adapted for any regression task to:
- Evaluate the impact of batch size on model performance.
- Identify the most efficient batch size for training.
- Gain insights into the relationship between batch size and error metrics.

## General Use Cases
- Predicting any continuous variable (e.g., house prices, temperature, or pollutant levels).
- Optimizing hyperparameters for neural networks.
- Comparing the performance of different batch sizes to find the best fit for a dataset.

---

## Requirements
- Input dataset with clearly defined features and target variables.
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`, `pandas` (for data manipulation)
  - `tensorflow`, `keras` (for deep learning)
  - `sklearn` (for data splitting and metrics)
  - `matplotlib` (for visualization)

This modular code structure allows users to easily replace the dataset, modify the features and target, or experiment with different model architectures.
